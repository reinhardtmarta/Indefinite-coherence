        # For n_qubits > ~20, performing Lindblad evolution by converting an MPS 
        # to a dense state (e.g., `qu.QuantumState` or `qu.DenseDM`) and then 
        # using their `time_evolve` method is computationally infeasible due to
        # exponential memory requirements (2^n_qubits elements).
        # 
        # To properly perform Lindblad evolution for 127 qubits with an MPS, 
        # you would need to implement or use specialized MPO (Matrix Product Operator)
        # evolution techniques (e.g., by constructing an MPO for the density matrix
        # and evolving it using MPO-specific algorithms in `quimb.tensor`).
        # 
        # The following lines related to `time_evolve` have been removed/commented out
        # as they would cause a MemoryError for large n_qubits like 127, and the 
        # `qu.State` class itself does not exist in `quimb`.
        # 
        # For now, the code proceeds without time evolution for the MPS.
        # If time evolution is critical, the entire approach for this section 
        # would need to be re-designed for MPO-based Lindblad evolution.
